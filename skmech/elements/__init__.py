elm-type
defines the geometrical type of the n-th element:

1
2-node line.

2
3-node triangle.

3
4-node quadrangle.

4
4-node tetrahedron.

5
8-node hexahedron.

6
6-node prism.

7
5-node pyramid.

8
3-node second order line (2 nodes associated with the vertices and 1 with the edge).

9
6-node second order triangle (3 nodes associated with the vertices and 3 with the edges).

10
9-node second order quadrangle (4 nodes associated with the vertices, 4 with the edges and 1 with the face).

11
10-node second order tetrahedron (4 nodes associated with the vertices and 6 with the edges).

12
27-node second order hexahedron (8 nodes associated with the vertices, 12 with the edges, 6 with the faces and 1 with the volume).

13
18-node second order prism (6 nodes associated with the vertices, 9 with the edges and 3 with the quadrangular faces).

14
14-node second order pyramid (5 nodes associated with the vertices, 8 with the edges and 1 with the quadrangular face).

15
1-node point.

16
8-node second order quadrangle (4 nodes associated with the vertices and 4 with the edges).

17
20-node second order hexahedron (8 nodes associated with the vertices and 12 with the edges).

18
15-node second order prism (6 nodes associated with the vertices and 9 with the edges).
