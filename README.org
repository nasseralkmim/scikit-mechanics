* scikit-mechanics

This project is a collection of modules for solving mechanics models.
So far, its capable of solving the plane problem using the Finite Element Method with a simple quadrilateral element with linear shape functions.

* How to use

scikit-mechanics was designed so its really simple to perform a mechanical analysis.
The first step is to set up a mesh file, I recommed using [[http://gmsh.info/][gmsh]] for that.
The mesh file (=.msh=) follows the formatting:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$MeshFormat
2.2 0 8
$EndMeshFormat
$Nodes
4
1 0 0 0
2 0.001 0 0
3 0.001 0.001 0
4 0 0.001 0
$EndNodes
$Elements
5
1 1 2 2 1 1 2
2 1 2 3 2 2 3
3 1 2 4 3 3 4
4 1 2 1 4 4 1
5 3 2 3 10 1 2 3 4
$EndElements
#+END_EXAMPLE

which represents a single element with 4 nodes, and 5 elements.
The elements with type 1 (second number) indicates lines with two nodes, are specified as physical elements for applying boundary conditions.
The element type 3 is the quadrilateral element.

This file is then used to perform a static analysis:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import skmech

E, nu, H, sig_y = 250e9, 0.25, 50e9, 2.5e6  # Pa, -, Pa, Pa
msh = skmech.Mesh('one.msh')
displbc = {1: (0, None), 2: (None, 0)}
mat = skmech.Material(E={3: E},
                      nu={3: nu},
                      H={3: H},
                      sig_y0={3: sig_y},
                      case='strain')
trac = {3: (5e6, 0)}        # boundary condition on physical element 3
model = skmech.Model(
    msh, material=mat, displacement_bc=displbc,
    thickness=1e-3, traction=trac)

u = skmech.statics.solver(model)

sig = skmech.postprocess.stress_recovery_smoothed(model)
sig_x = {nid: sig[nid][0] for nid in model.nodes.keys()} # x-component
# save to post processing file
skmech.gmshio.write_field(u, 'one', 'Displacement', ndim=2)
skmech.gmshio.write_field(sig_x, 'one', 'Sigma x', ndim=1)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
